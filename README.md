Oct2-7 Assignment on playing with R and trignometric functions

* Plot sin, cos and tan functions for values 0 - 8 \( \pi\) radians

** final deliverable is in a single plot, 3 colors with legend describing what function it is

* Plot sin, cos and tan functions for values 0 -720 degrees

** final deliverable is in a single plot, 3 colors with legend describing what function it is

* Get values for sin, cos and tan for 0,15,30,45,60,75,90 degrees

** Print the values

* Plot the functions

** 1 - sinxcosx for x 0 - 2 \pi radians

** sinx - cosx for x 0 - 2 \pi radians

** 1- square(tanx) for x 0 - 2 \pi radians
